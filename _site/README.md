Hi!

This is the repo for developing the Build FOSH following demand website.

Here are some nice to knows:

- Because we want to use plugins that are not supported by github.io, we need
to generate the pages of the website locally, and then push them to github.
This is a bit counter-intuitive when considering how github.io pages is setup,
but it allows to use many plugins, taking full advantage of Jekyll features.
a nice explanation on how to do this is [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/jekyll-plugins-github/)

- we are offering multi language support using this [tutorial](https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/)
